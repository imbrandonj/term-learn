# term-learn
A simplified terminology quizzing webpage used for my own studies.
  
I was using Quizlet for the terminology quizzing aspect of it, but the free edition only allows a certain amount of attempts before you must pay.
  
I got tired of this feature and figured I'd just make my own app to learn terms.  
Maybe one day I'll connect a db and allow the user to make their own sets.
